          <h2>Security of Your Personal Data</h2>
          <p>
            We take steps to protect the personal information of our users from
            unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. This may include using
            encryption, secure servers, and other security measures.
          </p>

            However, no method of transmission over the Internet is completely
            secure, and we cannot guarantee the security of user information.
            Users should take care to protect their own personal information,
            including choosing strong passwords and keeping them confidential.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will notify users of any data breaches that may affect their
            personal information as required by law.
